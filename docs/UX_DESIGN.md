# mlxtop UX design rules

These rules apply to the terminal UI and to reviews of UI changes. Extend the
existing visual language before introducing a new convention.

## Naming and typography

| Element | Convention | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation | Title case | Overview, MLX Top, Journal |
| Operational section heading | Uppercase | MODEL / STATE, THROUGHPUT, DIAGNOSIS |
| Chart title | Lowercase words; preserve acronyms | prompt load, generation, prefill, GPU |
| Status or compact metric label | Uppercase | LIVE, LAST SEEN, CACHE, HISTORY |
| Explanation or suggested action | Sentence case | Inspect added context or large tool results. |
| Keyboard hint | Match the actual key and use a short action | p pause, Home latest |

Charts at the same level must use the same title casing, weight, spacing and
border treatment. A chart does not become an operational section merely because
it spans the full width. Preserve standard units and names: tok/s, GiB, GPU,
oMLX and MLX. Use bold for the primary reading or status, not every line.

## Information hierarchy and space

- Overview answers: what is running, is it healthy, what is limiting it, and
  what should the operator inspect? Put current status and throughput first.
- Charts show trends and comparisons. Keep their primary reading, units and
  freshness adjacent. Keep supporting explanations shorter than the chart.
- On wide terminals, integrate prompt load into the chart grid at half width.
  Pair it with generation and prefill; group process memory and queue with
  supporting system metrics. Show a latency panel only when measured data exists.
- Use the smallest panel height that preserves readable values, labels and
  useful context. Extra terminal height should benefit the system traces;
  do not add empty rows to a request summary.
- Keep exact selected values readable independently of bar height. Give prompt
  history the full panel width, with one column per request and a single
  consolidated assessment in the bottom border. Do not put long
  request IDs or raw payloads in Overview; use Journal for request detail.
- At narrower widths, remove secondary detail before clipping primary values.
  Keep status, throughput, diagnosis and action available. Avoid wrapping chart
  headers or allowing long identifiers to displace readings.

## Color and emphasis

Use the existing palette; do not introduce per-widget color schemes.

| Role | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Healthy or favorable measured condition | Green plus a label or value |
| Condition worth inspecting | Yellow plus an explicit reason |
| Critical measured condition | Red plus an explicit reason |
| Chart identity | Existing metric color; a title color alone is not severity |
| Live request in prompt history | Cyan plus LIVE |
| Historical request in prompt history | Blue plus LAST SEEN or REPORTED and age |
| Material prompt increase | Yellow plus ! on the bar and a labeled comparison |
| Supporting text, unknown data, historical advice | Muted |

Never require color alone to interpret severity, freshness or selection. Use
text, symbols and values alongside it. A historical yellow bar records a past
comparison; it must not imply a current incident. Preserve captured severity
colors in time-series history instead of recoloring old samples on refresh.

## Metric truth and operator advice

- Keep implementation scope within mlxtop. Use existing provider interfaces
  and operating-system metrics; do not patch, inject into, reconfigure or
  restart serving runtimes to obtain counters. Omit unavailable-only dashboard
  summaries rather than filling operator space with implementation limitations.
- Unknown is `—`, not zero. Distinguish idle, stale, live and reported data.
- Show observation age for retained request values. Redrawing must not refresh
  their timestamps. Label historical assessments HISTORY.
- State chart units and scales. The prompt chart's 65,536-token ceiling is a
  display scale, not a model context limit; mark overflow and retain the exact
  selected value. Keep time-series gaps disconnected and one column per sample.
- Compare like-for-like provider/model observations. Say previous observed
  request; do not assume conversation membership or a tool loop.
- Show cache reuse only when reported for that request. Do not substitute an
  aggregate cache metric or infer latency from token counts alone.
- Stacked prompt bars use green for reported cached tokens, and cyan/live or
  blue/historical for the remainder. Unknown cache reuse stays unsplit. A yellow
  `!` marks prompt growth; `↑` takes precedence for overflow. Keep the selected
  `▲` on the timestamp row so neither marker hides it. UTC timestamp labels
  describe observations, while horizontal spacing represents request order.
  Cache availability must not alter bar height. Partial cells that cannot fit
  both segment colors and empty space use the dominant segment; the selected
  readout retains the precise count and reported cache reuse.
- Label OS process memory with its PID and source. Keep process footprint,
  RSS and allocator counters distinct. Lifetime peak must not be confused with
  a peak observed only during monitoring. Growth requires consecutive readings
  of the same process instance; positive growth alone does not imply severity.
- Suggestions must follow visible evidence. Treat prompt-growth thresholds as
  comparison heuristics, not health alarms. Keep historical advice muted.

## Interaction and review

- Preserve the three views: Overview, MLX Top and Journal. Place request load
  in Overview, with contextual history controls and a clear selected marker.
- Keep navigation, pause, history and quit keys consistent. Show only controls
  relevant to the active view.
- Review at 80×24, a medium terminal, and a wide terminal. Check empty, live,
  idle/historical, unavailable and large-value states when affected.
- For layout changes, inspect an actual terminal rendering. For data semantics,
  use focused tests that verify freshness, comparisons and missing data. Follow
  the build and validation checks in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
