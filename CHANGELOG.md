# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Select Overview charts with Tab, arrows or the mouse; zoom each history
  independently with +/− or the wheel, and enlarge/restore with Enter/Esc.
  Move sampling interval controls to { / }.
- Replace prompt-growth warning marks and advice with actual token counts,
  recent median and size range.
- Show measured slowdowns and concise evidence in Diagnostics; high GPU usage
  stays neutral and does not establish a compute bottleneck.
- Sound the terminal bell for critical memory pressure as well as severe paging,
  once per episode. Acknowledgment persists through unavailable samples.
- Report Linux temperatures without inferring throttling from a fixed threshold.

- On Linux, collect every NVIDIA GPU, with UUID-based identity, per-card utilization,
  VRAM and temperature. Keep unavailable readings distinct from zero.
- Add a responsive GPU device panel to Overview; use `[` / `]` to select
  cards and reveal additional rows on smaller terminals. GPU summaries and
  history use the explicitly labeled maximum utilization across cards.
- Include every NVIDIA device in `--once` reports and run Rust CI on Linux
  as well as macOS.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-09-29

- Publish static Linux binaries for x86_64 and aarch64; the terminal installer
  now supports Linux as well as macOS on Apple Silicon.
- Introduce release-candidate versions using `X.Y.Z-rc.N`, including support
  for RC version strings in macOS packages and disk-image names.
- Expand prompt history across the panel with one bar per request and a
  consolidated UTC timestamp readout for the selected observation.
- Keep llama-server live telemetry alongside client-reported prompt history;
  poll slots and metrics independently and sum output across all active slots.
- Read llama-server active/deferred queue gauges without treating average rates
  as live generation speed.
- Recognize runtime entrypoints consistently, including MLX-LM Python modules,
  KoboldCpp scripts, LocalAI, LM Studio's headless daemon and the Bionic app.
- Filter usage files by provider, deduplicate request IDs and accept
  Responses-style usage and LM Studio model instance identifiers.
- Add a tested counters-only Python client helper with concurrent append support.
- Distinguish KoboldCpp generation IDs after an observed uptime reset.
- Keep successive oMLX distributed requests separate in prompt history by using
  rank zero's request IDs instead of the shared `rank0` placeholder.
- Report oMLX queue counts, rates and output across every loaded model and
  concurrent request, rather than only the first active model and request.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-15

- Fix disconnected corners in process-memory and queue traces.
- Give active and waiting requests one labeled zero baseline. A white `═`
  marks overlapping trace cells; exact counts and overflow remain visible.
- Show explanatory messages instead of empty indicator plots when no samples
  exist.
- Shorten prompt insights in narrow panels and use fractional bar heights
  when request cache counts are unknown.
- Update the installer, downloads and documentation to v1.1.1.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-15

### Operator dashboard

- Integrate prompt load into the wide Overview grid beside generation and
  prefill, retaining a stacked layout for smaller terminals.
- Show request input counts, freshness, previous-request changes and recent
  comparisons. Display cached/uncached segments only when reported for that
  request, with bounded history and keyboard navigation.
- Add active/waiting queue history and OS process-footprint charts. Keep
  missing readings as gaps and identify the measured process by PID.
- Show macOS process footprint, lifetime peak and signed memory growth without
  modifying or restarting the serving runtime.
- Display first-token latency only when explicit client timing is supplied.
  Otherwise, retain the recent Journal preview in that space.
- Document consistent title casing, colors, layout and telemetry semantics.

### Providers and platforms

- Add request telemetry adapters for oMLX, llama.cpp and KoboldCpp, plus an
  optional counters-only usage file for client-reported responses, including
  MLX-LM, Ollama, LM Studio and LocalAI.
- Distinguish live observations from retained or reported results. Polling may
  miss requests that finish between samples; timing and cache data are never
  inferred from unrelated counters.
- Include Linux support using `/proc`, `/sys` and optional `nvidia-smi`.
  The published DMG remains for Apple Silicon macOS; Linux uses source builds.
- Add the macOS-only `libproc` dependency and its dependency license notices.

### Distribution

- Publish an Apple Silicon DMG with a native installer, documentation,
  dependency notices and SHA-256 checksum.
- Update the terminal installer and download links to v1.1.0.
- The binary targets macOS 11 or later and is tested on macOS 26.5.1. The
  installer is unsigned and the release is not Apple notarized.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-11

- Initial release with Overview, MLX Top, Journal, oMLX serving telemetry,
  macOS memory/paging/GPU inspection and the `--once` static report.
- Apple Silicon distribution with checksum verification and license notices.
